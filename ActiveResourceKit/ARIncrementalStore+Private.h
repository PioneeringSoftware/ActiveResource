 * @brief Answers a 64-bit version number derived from the given @a resource.
 * @details Uses the updated-at date-time as the version number. Converts the
 * update-at date to seconds since the reference date. This amounts to a big
 * version number, but the version number allows for 64 bits of unsigned integer
 * width.
 *
 * Also makes an assumption about the updated-at dates: that they always exceed
 * midnight 1st January 2001, the reference point. If they precede that point,
 * then the reference-relative time interval becomes negative, the signed
 * interval wraps the unsigned 64-bit version and version numbers start counting
 * down. This is not what Core Data will expect.
 *
 * The implementation multiplies the time interval by 1,000 in order to allow
 * for rare sub-second updates, if the server-side includes date-time at
 * sub-second resolutions. RFC 3339 date-time formats allow for sub-second
 * accuracy.

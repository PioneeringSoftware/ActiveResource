 * interval wraps the unsigned 64-bit version and version numbers start counting
 * down. This is not what Core Data will expect.
 *
 * The implementation multiplies the time interval by 1,000 in order to allow
 * for rare sub-second updates, if the server-side includes date-time at
 * sub-second resolutions. RFC 3339 date-time formats allow for sub-second

 * when you update an object, for the same reason. Object deletion also

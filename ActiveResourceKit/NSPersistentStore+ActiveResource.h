/**
 * Stores attach to coordinators, persistent store coordinators. Answers
 * all the stores attached to this store's coordinator _except_ this
 * store. Hence answers all other stores.
 *
 * This step is very important when a store builds a fetch
 * request. Narrow the scope of the affected stores to eliminate
 * recursion. Fetch requests apply to all the stores within a context by
 * default, including self.
 * @result An array for persistent stores excluding this store.

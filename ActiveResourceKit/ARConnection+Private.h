/*!
 * @brief Supplies default headers for the connection; none by default unless a
 * sub-class overrides this method.
 * @details Sub-classes can override this method to provide headers required for
 * the underlying connection. Please note however, the implementation
 * subsequently overwrites the format header. Similarly, user-supplied headers
 * override headers injected here as defaults.
 *
 * @par Interface Note
 * Rails' Active Resource gem calls this method @c default_header,
 * singular. This interface makes it @em plural since the answer is a dictionary
 * of headers.

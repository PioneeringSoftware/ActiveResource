/*!
 * @brief Loads attributes from a given resource.
 * @details Performs date conversions, using the managed object's entity
 * description to discover attributes. This approach makes an important
 * assumption: that your managed-object model represents the resource schema, or
 * at least part of the schema. There is only one difference: the naming
 * convention. The Core Data schema uses camel-case; the resource schema uses
 * underscored names. This method does not validate the schema however. It
 * silently ignores resource attributes that do not appear in the managed-object
 * model.
